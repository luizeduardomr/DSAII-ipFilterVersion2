# DSAII - ipFilterVersion2
This repository consists of a faculty project for Algorithm and Data Structure ll, which tries to filter a list of address pairs, which is between 0 and 2^31.
</br>
</br>
This repository is public in order to show the solution to the problem, __but it must not be reworked, copied, used, downloaded, disclosed or any other purpose.__ This repository is for the __private and exclusive__ use of students in the discipline of Algorithm and Data Structure ll (2) of class 137 - 2020/1 of the Software Engineering course at the Polytechnic School of PUCRS college.

## Proposed problem
The proposed problem suggests that, given a list with pairs of numerical values (IPs), we must create a solution so that the list has the largest possible reduction, compressing the maximum possible IP addresses. That is, the algorithm created from the reversal of all addresses and compresses it in order to let it be reduced. At the end, a compressed list must be presented that blocks the same IP addresses. The statement states that in an IP address, first is the smallest IP number that was banned, and then the last blocked IP number, these two values being included to be blocked.

## IPs list example
For example, following what has been said, we have some simplified address pairs for better understanding. In this IP list example, the final result, that is, the reduced IP list will be: __45389652-1045135809__.
